                <li>What is JavaScript? </li>
            </strong>
            <p>Ans:- 
                <ul>
                <li>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a Client side Scritpting language that is one of the core technologies of the
                 World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior,
                  often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the
                   code on users' devices.</li>
                <li>JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
                     It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. </li> 
                <li>JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications.
                     The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.</li>  
                </ul>     
                </p>

                <strong>
                    <li>What is the use of is NaN function?  </li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>isNaN() is a function property of the global object.</li>
                        <li> The isNaN() function determines whether a value is NaN when converted to a number.</li>
                        <li> Because coercion inside the isNaN() function can be surprising, you may alternatively want to use
                            Number.isNaN(). </li>
                        <li> Return value :- "true" if the given value is NaN after being converted to a number; otherwise, "false".
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                 </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>What is negative Infinity? </li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-The negative infinity in JavaScript is a constant value that is used to represent a value that is the lowest available.
                     This means that no other number is lesser than this value. It can be generated using a self-made function or 
                     by an arithmetic operation.
                
                    <dl> Negative infinity is different from mathematical infinity in the following ways:</dl>
                     </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Negative infinity results in -0(different from 0 ) when divided by any other number. </li>
                    <li>When divided by itself or positive infinity, negative infinity return NaN</li>
                    <li>Negative infinity, when divided by any positive number is negative infinity.</li>
                    <li>Negative infinity, divided by any negative number is positive infinity.</li>
                    <li>If we multiply negative infinity with NaN, we will get NaN as a result.</li>
                    <li>The product of 0 and negative infinity is Nan.</li>
                    <li>The product of two negative infinities is always a positive infinity.</li>
                    <li>The product of both positive and negative infinity is always negative infinity.</li>
                  </ul>   
                <strong>
                    <li>Which company developed JavaScript?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:- JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262
                     standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop 
                     JavaScript for the Firefox browser.</p>
                <strong>
                        <li>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>Undeclared variables are those that have not been declared or defined in the current scope</li>
                        <li>while undefined variables are those that have been declared but not given a value</li>
                        <li>Understanding the difference between these two terms is crucial for writing correct and effective
                            JavaScript code.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? </li>
                </strong>
                 <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creation of new element: New elements can be created in JS by using the createElement() method.</li>
                        <li>Setting the attributes of the created element: Attributes can be set using setAttribute() method.</li>
                    </ul>
                 </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>A ViewState is a state of a page within a browser wherein the values of controls persist when post back
                             operation is done. When another page is loaded, the previous page data is no longer available.</li>
                        <li>SessionState is the data of a user session and is maintained on the server side.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>What is === operator?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:- 
                    <ul>
                    <li>The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result.</li>
                     <li>Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be
                      different.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-There are two common approaches.
                    <ul>
                       <li> Changing CSS with the help of the style property:</li>
            
                        <code>document.getElementById("id").style.property = new_style</code>
            
                    <li>This property is used to set the current class of the element to the specified class.</li>
            
                        <code> document.getElementById("id").className = class</code>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>How to read and write a file using JavaScript?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:- The fs.readFile() and rs.writeFile() methods are used to read and write of a file using javascript.
                    <ol>
                        <li>The file is read using the fs.readFile() function, which is an inbuilt method.
                             This technique reads the full file into memory and stores it in a buffer. </li>
                         <code>fs.readFile( file_name, encoding, callback_function)</code>   
                         <li>The fs.writeFile() function is used to write data to a file in an asynchronous manner. 
                            If the file already exists, it will be replaced.</li> 
                            <code>fs.writeFile( file_name, data, options, callback )</code>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>What are all the looping structures in JavaScript? </li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <h4>JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:</h4>
            
                        <li> for - loops through a block of code a number of times </li>
                        <li> for/in - loops through the properties of an object </li>
                        <li> for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object </li>
                        <li> while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true </li>
                        <li> do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript? </li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>To convert a string to an integer parseInt(), Number(), and Unary operator(+) 
                            function is used in javascript. </li>
                        <li>parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn't contain number.</li>
                        <li>If a string with a number is sent, then only that number will be returned as the output.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <strong>
                    <li>What is the function of the delete operator?</li>
                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>The delete operator removes a property from an object. </li>
                        <li>If the property's value is an object and there are no more references to the object, the object held by
                            that property is eventually released automatically.</li>
                    </ul>

                </strong>
                <p>Ans:-
                    <ul>
                        <li>In Javascript, popup boxes are used to display the message or notification to the user.
                             There are three types of pop-up boxes in JavaScript namely</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Alert Box:</b> It is used when a warning message is needed to be produced.When the
                             alert box is displayed to the user, the user needs to press ok and proceed.</li>
                            <code>alert("your Alert here")</code>

                        <li><b>Prompt Box:</b> It is a type of pop up box which is used to get the user input for further
                             use. After entering the required details user have to click ok to proceed next stage
                              else by pressing the cancel button user returns the null value.</li>
                            <code>prompt("your Prompt here")</code>

                        <li><b>Confirm Box:</b> It is a type of pop-up box that is used to get authorization or
                             permission from the user. The user has to press the ok or cancel button to proceed.</li>
                            <code>confirm("your query here")</code>
                    </ol>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The void operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined.</li>
                        <li>The void operator is often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive value, 
                            usually using void(0) (which is equivalent to void 0).</li>
                        <li>This is often used with hyperlinks.</li>
                        <li>Using “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag: Writing “javascript:void(0);” in anchor tag
                             can prevent the page to reload and JavaScript functions can be called on single or
                              double clicks easily.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript.</li>
                        <li>It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document.
                             We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.</li>
                        <h4>Syntax:-</h4>
